Task 2 - Generative Art for CS334 Module 1

Description:
In Streaks, I wanted to create a piece that played on specifics of the Becton Center Cafe. In addition to being designed for the specific LED layout of the space, I wanted to make something that also referenced the physical properties of the screens and their locations in proximity to the viewer. Specifically, one of things I discovered while mapping the locations of each screen was that the LEDs turn off when displaying black, thus creating the illusion that the screen is completely off and that the viewer just sees sheets of frosted glass on the wall. When colors are displayed, the LEDs turn on. So, I knew my piece was going to involve having streaks of color cut through the “glass,” which provides a surprise for the viewer that the glass is in fact alive. Streaks of color travel through the squares outside of the Cafe, into the ceiling of the Cafe and flows over the vertical wall, filling it with vibrant colors.

I hope that this piece creates a sense of calmness within the space, as the display is designed to be mostly off during the animations, and yet leaves the viewer wanting more as each streak of color makes its appearance.

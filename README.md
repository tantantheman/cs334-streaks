Task 2 - Generative Art for CS334 Module 1

In this module, I will be creating a piece of generative art designed for the Becton Center's various LED panels. 

Task #2 asks you to use the physical layout you have discovered in Task #1 to create a generative art installation for the Becton LED Canvas. This is the first open-ended, creatively driven project of the class. The goal is to introduce you to the challenge of working with an underspecified problem - modelling the typical real world constraints given to installation artists of: “make something for this space”.

The system design for this task may be completed as a group. In particular, you may find it helpful to reuse code from Task #1. However, each individual must have their own documentation and make their own creative parameter selection, such that, from an artistic perspective, the works are distinct. Each individual must submit a repository on their own account.

Your work is not limited to visuals - you may also do some sound design that runs off of the Raspberry Pi. This does that mean that you can ignore the visual component though. You must actively make a creative decision about what is displayed on the screen, and justify this decision in your README (see below). If you are working in a group, you may utilize group members visualizations, and other in your group may utilize your sonification

Deliverables:

(10 pts) A link to your git repository with a program that runs on a Raspberry Pi to generate a visual for the Becton LED Canvas. The program must meet the following criteria:
(3 pts) Be generative as defined in the course text (now you have to at least skim the reading)
(3 pts) Start on boot of the Raspberry Pi, and display fullscreen.
(3 pts) Utilize in some way the pixel layout from Task #1. Note that this does not necessitate a “one-to-one” mapping onto the physical space, but your installation must in someway be “specialized” to this particular LED canvas.
(1 pts) Is in the spirit of the class as broadly interpreted by the instructors. Art is subjective, we want you to get comfortable with this ethos.
Standard Documentation Deliverables:
In addition to the project specific deliverables lists above, you must also meet the following “standard documentation deliverables”. Throughout this course, we will ask you to document your work in order to slowly build a portfolio of your projects. Going forward, these types of standard documentation deliverables can be assumed to be required for all assignments unless specified otherwise.

A blog post

Using the CoursePress site available through Canvas, make a blog post describing your art. The post should give an overview of your artistic vision. In particular for this assignment, you should address how you have specialized your generative art to the space. What creative decisions did you work lead you to, and which decisions did you take? How were your decisions motivated by your large creative vision for this project. In the same vein, also address any technical issues you encountered in your work. Particularly focus on issues that other artists may encounter when developing a generative art display for this space.

A README

On your github repo add a readme that contains a short description and key information on reproducibility/installation/usage. This readme can/should be a subset of the material used in your CoursePress blog post

A video of your art

Include in the README a link to your video. The video can be a simple video shot on your phone - the only goal is to have a record of your art in action. You can host the video wherever you like as long as the hosting platform supports in-browser playback (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo).

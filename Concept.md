Note: This document will become the ACTUAL readme upon task completion. Current README.md acts as a placeholder for the assignment prompt.

Concept: The art piece is meant to simulate a flow-pipe of water, leading into the waterfall that is the Becton Cafe screen. At randomly generated intervals, the furthest LED panel from the Becton Cafe reveals a stream of blue that travels across the remaining square LED panels, in different amounts and different shades of blue. Then, the "liquid" travels across the top of the Cafe screen, as if the water flows from the panels to the edge of the Cafe screen where it turns vertical. Then, the water flows "over" the edge and down the vertical section of the screen, spreading out in different ways as it falls down into the unknown depths. 

Generative factors:
1. Water release intervals
2. Amount of water released
3. Shade of water 
4. Speed of water
5. Spread pattern/length on waterfall portion

General notes:
How do we simulate flowing water as shapes? Do shades alternate as the pass by to create the illusion of movement?
